# Compatibility Predictor

Aloha Datahouse!

This solution is a HTML webpage which consists of Javascript and CSS.

The solution reads the JSON input file using the XMLHttpRequest object in the parseJSON.js Javascript file. There's no specific user action needed to specifically input the JSON file because the JSON input file is read on line 8 in the parseJSON.js. The output is generated automatically when viewing the index.html webpage.

The solution can be view at https://wlhiew.github.io/index.html

Let me know if you have any questions or if you run into any difficulties viewing the solution!

Thanks and Mahalo!
